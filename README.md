This project pertains to my undergraduate thesis conducted at the Federal University of SÃ£o Carlos, focusing on sentiment analysis. The code contained in this repository relates to the training of three language models: BERT, RoBERTa and BERTimbau.


# Project Setup
Runs this  commands to setting up the enverioment:

- `python3 -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate`
- `pip install -r requirements.txt`

# Running the model
To run the code, simply insert the training, testing, and validation datasets, and then update the model_name variable in the main.py file. After making these changes, execute the main.py file by running the command:
